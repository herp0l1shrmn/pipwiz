# pipwiz: Python Package Management Wizard

A beginner-friendly, cross-platform GUI wizard for installing, upgrading, and uninstalling Python packages using pip.
There's also searching in this application, where you can search for packages using a modified version of PyPI.
Built with PyQt5. No command-line knowledge required!

## Requirements

The requirements needed to run this file are:

1. Python 3.7 or newer (not recommended to use before 3.7)
2. PyQt5 (the application is highly dependent on this library to work, there's also a failsafe for when PyQt5 is not installed)
